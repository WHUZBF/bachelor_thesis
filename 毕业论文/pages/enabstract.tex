This paper is based on the bosonic string and the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) superstring. It systematically calculates superstring scattering amplitudes for open and closed strings under disk and sphere topologies, while introducing the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations between disk and sphere amplitudes, as well as the monodromy relations satisfied by disk amplitudes. By employing the pure spinor superstring formalism and utilizing the multi-particle superfield method, we rigorously derive a universal expression for disk amplitudes of open strings with arbitrary massless states. Based on the string length limit, we successfully construct amplitudes of 10-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory from pure spinor superspace cohomology. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm for constructing Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators that satisfy color-kinematics duality at tree level.
